# SF-Resturant-Safety-Analysis
In this project, we will investigate restaurant food safety scores for restaurants in San Francisco. The scores and violation information have been made available by the San Francisco Department of Public Health. The main goal for this assignment is to walk through the process of Data Cleaning and EDA. This project get practice with working with data at different levels of granularity, identifying the type of data collected, missing values, anomalies, etc, and exploring characteristics and distributions of individual variables.

As a result:

• We found that the records are at the inspection level and that we have inspections for multiple years.

• We also found that many restaurants have more than one inspection a year.

• By joining the business and inspection data, we identified the name of the restaurant with the worst rating and optionally the names of the restaurants with the best rating.

• We identified the restaurant that had the largest swing in rating over time.

• We also examined the change of scores over time! Many restaurants are not actually doing better.

• We created cool hexbin plots to relate the ratings with the location of restaurants. Now we know where to go if we want good food.
